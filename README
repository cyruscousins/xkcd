XKCD

An experimental program created by Cyrus Cousins, using drawings by Randall Monroe.

This program utilizes an interesting 3D noise function for particles and a linear transformation system for world transforms (though currently I render points of a rotated object to the canvas, causing gaps in the image.  When I get around to it, points on the image should ask the rotated object for color value).

This code is completely unfinished and occasionally crashes, but I haven't worked on it for a while and don't really have any plans for it.  I figured I'd release it because it's quite fun and good learning material.

The source was originally created in a custom language that source to source compiles down to java, this distribution is the java.  Someday I will release the language specification, compiler, compiler source, and the original source of this program, but it needs more development to realize some of the more advanced features I have planned.

Enjoy.

Someone somewhere on the internet made some of the font xkcd.ttf and I made a few characters myself.  I think he wanted people to mention if they used his font, so I am mentioning it right now.  Google it and you might even find the original.
